          <p class="p-large">Gulp! It’s hard to swallow isn’t it?! I'm sure you're shocked to see the financial impact that
            one 'bad egg' has had on your business. This doesn’t take into account the paid wages
            you’ve already flushed down the loo.
            Below we’ve broken down the hidden cost, so you can see exactly what contributes to
            this figure.

                <p>There’s a bunch of job boards out there where
                  you can post adverts but Trademe Jobs and
                Seek are the most used in the hospo industry. The above cost is an average price listing.</p>

                <h4 class="entry-title">TRAINING $2,100</h4>
                <p>Every business and every job requires different
                  levels and types of training. Inductions, health
                  and safety, on the job training, workshops, apprenticeships and assessments are
                  typical in hospitality. We’ve calculated an
                average cost for training across the industry.</p>

                <h4 class="entry-title">RECRUITMENT $1,540</h4>
                <p>The average time to fill a job in hospo is
                  20.7 days. Advertising, screening,
                  scheduling meetings, interviewing, trials, background checks through to contract
                  and onboarding will take you on average
                  28 – 40 hours. It’s usually Senior
                  Management or Head/Executive Chef
                  managing the recruitment process – so
                  we’ve estimated this cost as 28 hours @
                  $55/hr.

                <h4 class="entry-title">TOOLS / EQUIPMENT $1,000</h4>
                <p>Most jobs have a range of tools or equipment
                  required by a new employee – these could
                  include uniform, clothing, licences or
                  certificates, knives, machinery, phone or
                  laptop. We have calculated an average cost of

                <p>This is the mac daddy of the hidden costs. To
                  arrive at this figure we’ve taken the average
                  industry income and productivity, the salary of
                  your bad hire and conservatively factored
                  against things such as opportunity cost, loss of
                  productivity, customer dissatisfaction, bad
                  reviews and the impact a toxic worker can
                have on team morale and culture.</p>

                <p>It’s not just the employee's weekly wages
                  you need to take into consideration, you’ll
                  also need to factor in things such as
                  Kiwisaver contributions and ACC Levies.
                  It's compulsory to match employee
                  contributions – so if your new recruit opts
                  in for Kiwisaver you’ll be looking at a minimum of 3% of their gross pay.

                <p>Now you’ll need to start the process all
                  over again, investing more time and money
                  to re recruit, so make sure you get it right
                  this time! This cost is based upon re
                  advertising, recruitment, training, and any
                  required tools or equipment.
